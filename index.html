            <i>I am in 10th class, in takshashila group. Our class teacher is Ankita Ma'am. She takes our care very well and everyone likes her. Ankita Ma'am teaches us physics and she teaches us very well. My other subject teachers are:
                <pre>
                    Sanskrit - Reeta mam
                    English - Meera mam
                    Gujarati - Meena mam
                    Maths  - Monalisa mam
                    Computer - Anjali mam
                    Economics - Rajshree mam
                    History - Baijayanti mam
                                        Geography - Both Rajshree mam and Baijayanti mam
                    Biology - Leeta mam
                    Chemistry - Nandini mam
                </pre>
                . Our all teachers do their job perfectly and teaches us with perfection. From class 9, we have to choose whether to study hindi or sanskrit and i chose sanskrit. Therefore I study all the subjects except Hindi. And that's all I have got about my class. My class and teachers are SUPER AMAZING!</i>
